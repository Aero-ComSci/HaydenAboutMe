        <h2>Career Goals</h2>
        <p>Computers are everywhere, and they can control/do everything that we do. To understand how computers operate and how we can change them, you would need to understand computer science. This is why I have chosen to pursue computer science by taking classes, and I eventually hope to become a Software Engineer.</p>

        <h2>Strengths and Personal Qualities</h2>
        <p>A strength that I have is self motivation, as I constantly push myself to get good grades on assignments. This trait also applies to after school activities such as piano, and I push myself to practice for at least 5 hours a week. A personal quality I have is being able to learn information quickly and being able to adapt to situations.</p>

        <h2>Important Achievements</h2>
        <p>I don't have any major accomplishments from high school <em>yet</em>, but something I have achieved so far is passing Geometry with a 99.5%. Activities that I participate in outside of school are Piano and Taekwondo. I have been playing the piano for 8 years now, and Taekwondo for 3 years.</p>

        <h2>My Abilities and Work Skills</h2>
        <p>Something I have learned about from taking a class over the summer is that procrastination can easily cause you to fall behind, because the course is designed for a full year of learning, and doing the course in two months is about 6 times faster. I unfortunately had to learn this the hard way, as I delayed on starting the course for two weeks, which led to having to sit in front of a screen for hours every day to make up for those two missed weeks.</p>
